Usage
---
__Install/Download:__

	git clone https://github.com/h0wser/SugBot

__Run:__

	python main.py

On arch for example, the program is run with:
	
	prompt> python2 main.py

Config: 
-----
The bot's behaviour is controlled via 2 files: config.json and responses.py.

**_config.json_** tells the bot of the name of the chat and what types of messages/commands there are.

The __commands__ array details what the bot does with a "!xxcommand" message sent in the chat it's listening to. 
Every object in commands has 3 properties: chat_command, response, type

* __chat_command__ is a string that represents this command in chat 
* __response__ is either a message string containing a response __or__ the name of a function that is defined in _responses.py_
* __type__ can be _text_ or _call_ and defines how __response__ is interperted

The __timed_messages__ array contains messages that are to be sent at a specific time. 
Every object in timed_messages has 2 properties: message and time

* __message__ is the message to be sent 
* __time__ is the time at which to send the message(duuh). The format is HH:MM:SS

**_responses.py_** defines functions referenced by the json in _config.json_.

The functions must return a string which will be the message sent to the chat.

The _bot_ parameter is a reference to the bot to enable commands to query information about the bot, (for example to implement a _help_ command) 
and to change the state of the bot (like _sleep for 5 minutes_).
Functions can take in an _args_ variable that can be used to pass arguments to the command. The _args_ paramater is a list of arguments extracted from the command message. 

__Example:__

	def foo(bot, args)
		bar = args[0]
	return bar
	
You can use any type of python code, in _responses.py_, to implement the message returned. Because of this, the possibilty of customization is endless.
